## Description
 This is an application demonstrating CSS manipulation which allows boxes to float across the screen.

##  📖 How this app might be used.
#### Features

```
- The boxes can be resized.
- The background of each box can be a different colour.
- The background of each box can hold an image or text.
- The rotation of each box can be faster or slower.
- New shapes can be created.
```

#### Why use this animation.

```
- A floating box can add colour, texture and interest 
to an app.
- More interesting and engaging than a pop-up 
because they have to wait for it to go round again 
to catch any content they missed.
- Ideal for creating a relaxing meditative experience.
```

#### Important Note 
```
- If the application will be used on mobile devices, do not put too much text in each box.

```
